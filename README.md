# The learning concept 

EN

The flags and capitals learning app is based on a specific concept inspired by Anki. A flag or the name of a country is displayed, and the user must decide whether they know it or not, in their own conscience. Then, the answer is revealed, and the user can choose from three difficulty levels: easy, medium, or difficult. Depending on their choice, the country or capital will be presented more or less frequently in the future, based on the user's knowledge. The goal is to provide personalized learning based on user confidence. If the user plays correctly, the algorithm will select countries or capitals optimized for learning. Enjoy this unique learning experience!

FR

L'application d'apprentissage des drapeaux et des capitales repose sur un concept particulier inspiré de l'application Anki. Un drapeau ou le nom d'un pays est affiché, et l'utilisateur doit décider s'il le connaît ou non, en son âme et conscience. Ensuite, la réponse est révélée et l'utilisateur a le choix entre trois niveaux de difficulté : facile, moyen ou difficile. Selon le choix effectué, le pays ou la capitale sera présenté plus ou moins fréquemment par la suite, en fonction de la connaissance de l'utilisateur. L'objectif est d'offrir un apprentissage personnalisé, basé sur la confiance de l'utilisateur. Si l'utilisateur joue correctement, l'algorithme sélectionnera des pays ou des capitales optimisés pour l'apprentissage. Profitez de cette expérience d'apprentissage unique !
